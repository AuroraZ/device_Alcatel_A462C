# device_Alcatel_A462C

This phone DOES NOT have the MTK chipset it is a Qualcomm chipset phone. The files I have upload come from the twrp.sh compiler file found at http://forum.xda-developers.com. I hope they can help other compile custom TWRP recoveries for their phones as well. I am still working on mine and will update this when I have new info.
